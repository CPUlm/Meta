## Example : SumProd
You will find here the code to build and execute on the CPUlm VirtualMachine
the _SumProd_ program. This program is used to demonstrate what our tools can do.

Use:
- `make build-asm` to build the assembly code of `sum_prod.ulm`.
- `make print-encoded` to show what the assembly does.
- `make run-vm` to start the VirtualMachine on the assembled code.
- `make clean` to clean !

Have fun !
