## Example : 4 bit Adder
You will find here the code to demonstrate what the CSimulator can do.
In this example, we simulate a 4 bit adder.

Use:
- `make show-blocks` to show the blocks that the CSimulator have computed
- `make build` to build the NetList to a C program.
- `make simulate` to build and execute the C program.
- `make clean` to clean !

Be Happy !
